        <h2>Get Diagnosed</h2>
        <p>Everyone goes through tough times. But sometimes, the negative way someone feels inside -- depressed, anxious, wanting to avoid people, having trouble thinking -- may be more than the ups and downs most people feel now and then. If symptoms like these start to get in the way of your life, or that of a loved one, it’s important to take action. Research shows that getting help early can prevent symptoms from getting worse and make a full recovery more likely.
           The first step is to get a mental health assessment. It usually involves a couple of different things. You may answer questions verbally, get physical tests, and fill out a questionnaire.</p>
        <p>A mental health assessment is when a professional -- like your family doctor, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist -- checks to see if you might have a mental problem and what type of treatment may help. Visit these sites to find out where you can get assessed.</p>

        <h2>Get Treated</h2>
        <p>You're not out of the norm if you feel like talk therapy, aka psychotherapy or counseling, isn't a super effective way to manage your mental health. The success of talk therapy varies from individual to individual, and can also depend on mental health diagnosis and severity. Some researchers think the effectiveness of talk therapy is somewhat exaggerated. Here are so resources to find new methods of treament.</p>

        <h3>What Is Sliding Scale Therapy?</h3>
    </p>A sliding scale is a type of fee structure therapists sometimes use to give people with fewer resources a lower fee. In fact, the sliding scale fee is commonly used in many types of industries including legal service or dental care. Affordable sliding-scale therapy is not a "sale" or a "discount" that can change over time. The amount you pay for affordable sliding-scale therapy is calculated by your income. The less income you bring in each month, the less you pay for your therapy sessions.</p>
