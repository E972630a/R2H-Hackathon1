        <p class="paragraphs">Everyone goes through tough times. But sometimes, the negative way someone feels inside -- depressed, anxious, wanting to avoid people, having trouble thinking -- may be more than the ups and downs most people feel now and then. If symptoms like these start to get in the way of your life, or that of a loved one, it’s important to take action. Research shows that getting help early can prevent symptoms from getting worse and make a full recovery more likely.
           The first step is to get a mental health assessment. It usually involves a couple of different things. You may answer questions verbally, get physical tests, and fill out a questionnaire.</p>
        <p class="paragraphs">A mental health assessment is when a professional -- like your family doctor, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist -- checks to see if you might have a mental problem and what type of treatment may help. Visit these sites to find out where you can get assessed.</p>

        <h3 class="h3p">What Is Sliding Scale Therapy?</h3>
    <p class="paragraphs">A sliding scale is a type of fee structure therapists sometimes use to give people with fewer resources a lower fee. In fact, the sliding scale fee is commonly used in many types of industries including legal service or dental care. Affordable sliding-scale therapy is not a "sale" or a "discount" that can change over time. The amount you pay for affordable sliding-scale therapy is calculated by your income. The less income you bring in each month, the less you pay for your therapy sessions.</p>
